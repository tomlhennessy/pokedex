Pokedex – Explore the World of Pokémon

1. What's the problem?
Pokémon fans often struggle to find an engaging and comprehensive resource for browsing Pokémon information, including their moves, stats, and images. Many resources are overwhelming or lack interactivity.

2. How am I going to solve it?
Develop a front-end application that:
• Fetches real-time Pokémon data from the PokéAPI, including stats, moves, and images.
• Allows users to search and navigate between different Pokémon easily.
• Stores fetched data locally to optimize performance and improve user experience.
• Presents the information in a visually appealing and responsive interface.

4. Any issues I came up with?
• API Limitations: Managing API requests efficiently to avoid performance bottlenecks or rate limits.
• Data Organization: Structuring locally-stored data for quick access and minimal lag when navigating between Pokémon.
• Search Functionality: Designing a search experience that is both fast and user-friendly while handling edge cases like invalid or empty inputs.

5. What is the final solution?
Pokedex is a responsive web app that showcases detailed information about 151 original Pokémon. Key features include:
• Real-time data fetching from the PokéAPI for moves, stats, and images.
• A search bar and navigation system to quickly browse Pokémon.
• Local storage of fetched data to improve speed and reduce redundant API calls.
• A polished UI built with React and fantaCSS, ensuring a delightful user experience.
